This project is meant to provide a set of Roslyn Analyzers that makes it easy to catch, discover and implement a wide array of best practices when building Visual Studio extensions.

Check out our [exhaustive list of analyzers](doc/index.md) defined in this project.

This package is not yet published to nuget.org. To use these analyzers now, add this NuGet v2 feed to your package sources: https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/vssdk-analyzers.

If you have an idea for a rule that would constitute a best practice for extension authors to follow, please open an issue with the description.
